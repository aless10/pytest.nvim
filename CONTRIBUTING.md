# Contributing to pytest.nvim
we are glade seeing you here, thanks for spending time for this project

## How to setup pytest.nvim
nothing special needed just install it normally

[Installation Guide](README.md/#installation)

## Tests
there is no tests yet but it will be in `lua/tests/` directory 
and this guide will be written more detail later 

## Style Guides

### Code Style
naming convention is camelCase for codes and snake_case for file names

### Commit Message Style
conventional commit message is required, PR without using conventional will not merge (I know right now it my dictatory :) )

and emojis are cool but it better to don't use them
